<h1>A bit about me</h1>

<p>I was born in the city of Bogotá. Ive spend more than 20 years looking for what actually is meaningful in life and not just
  what could be easy to do or what is the most feasible path. My journey took me to London three years ago, a massive city 
  full with a diverse culture, full of experiences and the most important one, full of love. Yes, im 25 years old and happily 
  married to the most wonderful, caring, sensible, gorgeous, responsable human being Ive ever met, my lovely wife Daniela.</p>

<p>Back in Bogotá I studied 2 different degrees at the same time, one was Social Communication (marketing) and Product Design, 
  this is something that is becoming quite usual in Colombia, but this put me in a very compromised situation with myself, 
  it was Covid time and I was a bit overhwelmed about my studies so I decided to take a 6 month english course 
  which led me to this big adventure.</p>

<p>My passion for communication and design drives me to constantly seek new forms of expression. With strong analytical skills,
  also in creativity and project management, I strive to make an impact through innovative strategies and persuasive messaging.
  With a proven track record of success in dynamic environments I am poised to tackle challenges and contribute to the success 
  of any team or project.</p>
